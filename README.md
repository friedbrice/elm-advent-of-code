# Advent of Code 2019 - Elm

This project is a scaffolding to help you get started solving
[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) puzzles in
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

## Setup

First, [install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html).

Second, clone this repository.

Third, jump into the repository directory in your terminal and run
`elm reactor`.

Forth, navigate to
[http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm](http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm)
in your browser.

You're ready to go. Put your code in the various `Day**.elm` files,
save the files, refresh your browser, and run your code there.

You may also want editor integration for Elm. Personally, I use
[Elm Syntax Highlighting](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Elm%20Syntax%20Highlighting)
for Sublime Text.

## Learning Elm

* [Learn Elm in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elm/)
  gives a very brief overview of Elm's syntax.

* The [Official Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) is the definitive
  resource for learning Elm.

* The [Package Docs](https://package.elm-lang.org/) explain how to use
  the predefined library functions.

* Of particular interest are the Package Docs for the
  [Core Libraries](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/)
  . Most of what you'll need can be found there.
