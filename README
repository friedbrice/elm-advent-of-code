# Advent of Code 2019 - Elm

This is project is a scaffolding to help you get started solving
[Advent of Code 2019][https://adventofcode.com/2019] puzzles in
[Elm][https://elm-lang.org/].

## Setup

First, [install Elm][https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html].

Second, clone the repository.

Third, jump into the repository directory in your terminal and run `elm reactor`.

Forth, navigate to [localhost:8000/src/Main.elm][http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm]
in your browser.

You're ready to go. Put your code in the various `Day**.elm` files, save
the file, refresh your browser, and run your code.

You may also want editor integration for Elm. Personally, I use
[Elm Syntax Highlighting][https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Elm%20Syntax%20Highlighting] for Sublime Text.
